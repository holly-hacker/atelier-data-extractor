# Atelier Data Extractor

This is a tool to extract structured data from the Atelier games by Gust. The main purpose of this tool is to provide
data for my Atelier wiki (to be open sourced at a later date), but the data it generates can be viewed and used by
anyone through the [atelier-data](https://github.com/holly-hacker/atelier-data) repo.
